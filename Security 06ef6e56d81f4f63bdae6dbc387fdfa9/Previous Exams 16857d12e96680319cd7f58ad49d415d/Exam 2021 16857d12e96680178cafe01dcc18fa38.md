# Question 10

In order to ensure that only authorised users can access a sensitive system, the
administrators have enforced a strict password policy requiring that all passwords
must be at least 16 characters and contain letters, numbers and special characters.
The system does not allow a user to choose a password that does not meet these
requirement. The passwords are stored in a database by hashing with salts.
Moreover, the system administrators have decided that passwords should be
changed every 3 months and have recommended all users to keep track of when
they last changed their passwords and to do so at the proper time. What is a
potential vulnerability in this password policy? Select one:

brute force attacks.

build efficient dictionaries that allow for quick guessing of passwords.
4. Using hashing with salts is not a secure method for storing human
readable passwords.

company has decided to install one Virtual Private Network (VPN) server that
allows its employees to securely access the same services that they usually have
access to in its internal network after performing user authentication. This
server works as the single gateway into the company’s internal network and is
connected to the internet by a single link. The company system administrators
have chosen to install a VPN server software that employs proprietary closed

security principles does this solution fail to employ? Select one:

1.  Psychological Acceptability and Least Privilege.

80/tcp open http
111/tcp open rpcbind
139/tcp open netbios-ssn
443/tcp open https

2. The web-server uses a vulnerable version of ssh.
3. The web-server does not meet the principle of minimum exposure .
    1. Korrekt - Den viser flere services, som ikke er nødvendige at vise.
        1. fx 111. 139, 2049, 6000, 2012

    1. KORREKT - Altså der er inkorrekt om block ciphers., fordi block ciphers kun kan encrypte beskeder som har samme længde som key’en.
4. When used in CBC mode, the key length of a Block Cipher is independent from the plaintext message length.

# Question 23:

In a PKI, what is the role of a Root Certification Authority (RCA)? Select one:

1. An RCA is trusted by users of a PKI in order to verify whether other certification authorities should be trusted.

    1. WRONG - Samme svar som ovenfor. RCA’en signerer dets subordinate og intermediate CAs, som så signerer end-user certifikater.
4. An RCA is a governmental organisation that controls the issuance of digital certificates over all PKIs
    1. WRONG - De er ikke nødvendigvis governmental. Det kunne lige så godt være private entities.

# Question 25:

A company has decided to deploy FTP and Telnet servers to allow its employees to access internal systems and files while working from home. After a few days of operating these services, the company suffers a large scale “ransomware” attack where an adversary encrypts all the companies files and disables access to all systems, charging the company a random fee in order to restore its files and systems. The system administrators had deployed firewalls successfully segregating the internal network from the internet (only allowing access to the FTP and Telnet servers) and issued all employees with specially hardened computers without exploitable flaws. Why could this attack have happened?
Select one:

1. The adversary used quantum cryptanalysis to recover plaintext passwords from TLS traffic that it eavesdropped on the internet.
2. The adversary performed IP spoofing in order to impersonate a company employee towards the firewall and the FTP/Telnet servers.

# Question 26:

Alice and Bob wish to transfer several files over an insecure network while ensuring their integrity and authenticity (i.e. ensuring that the file really comes from Alice or from Bob) in the presence of a Dolev-Yao attacker. In this scenario, it is infeasible for them to share the hash of every file they transfer in person. How can they perform this operation securely given that they have a cryptographic hash function and that they have securely exchanged a random binary string KEY before exchanging their files? Select one:

1. They can transfer the file along with a hash H(file|salt) and KEY XOR salt where salt is a random value chosen for every transfer.

1. The company can set up a stateful firewall allowing outgoing connections (i.e. connections from internal web servers) to TCP ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on external hosts
    1. Wrong - They cannot setup firewalls on external hosts.
2. The company can set up a stateful firewall allowing incoming connections (i.e. connections from external hosts) to TCP ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on their web servers.
    1. Korrekt - 
3. The company can set up a simple packet filtering firewall that forwards all packets from external hosts to internal web servers with destination TCP ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) but drops every other packet.
    1. Wrong -

    1. Wrong - 

# Question 38:

A popular two-factor authentication scheme requires that a user types in a password and a one-time number obtained from a hardware token. What authentication factors are involved in this scheme? Select one:

1. Knowledge only.
2. Knowledge and Possession.
    1. Korrekt - Knowledge is the password. Possession is the one-time number from the hardware token.
3. Knowledge and Inherence.
4. Inherence and Possession.

# Question 40:

Select the incorrect statement about digital certificates. Select one:

1. A Digital Certificate is issued to a user by a Certificate Authority.
    1. Wrong - Certificates are issued to users by CAs
2. A Digital Certificate can be revoked by its owner in cooperation with a Certificate Authority.
    1. Wrong - This is correct
3. Unique IDs can be used to identify Digital Certificates generated by a Certificate Authority.
    1. Wrong -
4. The public key in a Digital Certificate is generated by a Certificate Authority.
    1. Korrekt -

# Question 41:

A system implements a password based authentication scheme where password hashes are sent through a secure channel (e.g. TLS 1.3). How can this system be attacked? Select one:

1. The adversary can impersonate a user in the network and convince the system to accept the authentication.
    1. Wrong - 
2. The adversary can eavesdrop on password being transmitted through the network.
    1. Wrong - even finding the hash it is infeasible to find the original password. Source: Lecture 3
3. The adversary can guess password hashes and perform an attack using Rainbow Tables.
    1. Wrong - 
4. The adversary can perform a brute force password guessing attack.
    1. Korrekt - a brute force password guessing attack is possible

# Question 42:

An operating system stores user passwords on a table associating each password to a username. How can the operating system protect password confidentiality in case the table leaks while ensuring only a legitimate user who knows their password can be authenticated successfully? Select one:

1. By storing H(password),username.
    1. Wrong - Without salts passwords that are the same will have the same hash.
2. By storing all passwords encrypted with the AES block cipher under a key sk that is stored in the end of the table: Enc(sk,password),username
    1. Wrong - uhhhh
3. By storing salt,H(password|salt),username where salt is a random value and H() is a cryptographic hash function.
    1. Korrekt - Wooo den gode måde at gemme passwords på
4. By storing password,username in the clear and trusting that the table will never leak.
    1. Wrong - lol
