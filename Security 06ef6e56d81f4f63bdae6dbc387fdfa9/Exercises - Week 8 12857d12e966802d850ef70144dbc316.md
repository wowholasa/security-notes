# Exercise 4.5

**UNIX treats file directories in the same fashion as files; that is, both are defined by the same type of data structure, called an inode. As with files, directories include a nine-bit protection string. If care is not taken, this can create access control problems. For example, consider a file with protection mode 644 (octal) contained in a directory with protection mode 730. How might the file be compromised in this case?**

File with 644:

6 = Owner can read + write

4 = Group can read

4 = Other can read

Directory with 730:

7 = Owner can read + write + execute

3 = Group can write + execute

0 = Others have no permissions

So in theory a a group could overwrite the file.

# Exercise 4.8

**Assume an application requires access control policies based on the applicant’s age and the type of funding to be provided. Using an ABAC approach, write policy rules for each of the following scenarios:**

1.  **If the applicant’s age is more than 35, only “Research Grants (RG)” can be provided.**
2. **If the applicant’s age is less than or equal to 35, both “RG and Travel Grants (TG)” can be provided.**

Answers: 

u = user

g = grant

e = environment (ignored here)

R1: can_access(u, g, e) ← 

( Age(u) > 35 && Type(g) $\in$ { RG } ) ||
( Age(u) ≤ 35 && Type(g) $\in$ { RG, TG } )
